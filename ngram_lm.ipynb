    "- understand the difficulties of counting and probablities in NLP applications\n",
    "- work with real world data to build a functioning language model\n",
    "- stress test your model (to some extent)\n",
    "\n",
    "Complete in groups of: __one (individually)__\n",

    "Allowed python modules:\n",
    "- `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and all built-in python libraries (e.g. `math` and `string`)\n",
    "- do not use `nltk` or `pandas`\n",
    "\n",
    "Instructions:\n",
    "- Complete outlined problems in this notebook. \n",
    "- When you have finished, __clear the kernel__ and __run__ your notebook \"fresh\" from top to bottom. Ensure that there are __no errors__. \n",
    "    - If a problem asks for you to write code that does result in an error (as in, the answer to the problem is an error), leave the code in your notebook but commented out so that running from top to bottom does not result in any errors.\n",
    "- Double check that you have completed Task 0.\n",
    "- Submit your work on Gradescope.\n",
    "- Double check that your submission on Gradescope looks like you believe it should."
